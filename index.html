          <p>I am a Data Scientist. I love solving real data problems and helping stakeholders make better informed decisions.
            My passion is building models adding value in business.</p><br>
          <p>
            I started learning to code my own custom functions when I was Studying Mathematics. Over time, I have gained experience and decided to pursue my graduate studies in Applied Statistics where I developped a new algorithm cPIE (calculated
            Panel Of Incompatible Epitopes)
            based on Incompatible Epitopes in Kidney Transplantation. At the same time I was developing my own Shiny Apps for Data Science Projects I worked on. I migrated to Python and I was able to incorporate the strength of different programming
            languages to carry
            out a data science project.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            My areas of focus is applying data science to business and health care.
            My best skill is my solid background in statistics. It allows me to understand and see
            beyond the models available in libraries or packages so I can create value for companies with my solutions.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            When I am free I enjoy reading technical books (currently learning üë©‚Äçüíª about the Julia programming language and cybersecurity).
            I also enjoy baking and cooking and try to come up with new recipes üë©‚Äçüç≥.

            <p>The model performance is measured against precision, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, recall and F1-Score.</p><br>
            <p>The analyzes showed that the neural networks outperform all other techniques when a variable selection step
              is carried out during the Pre-Processing of the data. In comparison with other studies our models perform better in terms of accuracy.</p><br>

              We are interested to assess the default risk (probability). TabNet and XGBoost models were applied and a Shiny App was built to facilitate the job for the client (Internal Auditor).</p> <br>

            <p>We were interested, after that, to see if there is a significant relationship, in business accounts, between the risk rating and the person granting the loan.</p><br>
            <p>Text analysis techniques were applied to extract information
              about the loan granting to enhance our machine learning models in order to help the Auditor interven before the borrower could access the money.</p><br>

              To better assit the auditor, a Shiny App is built to automate the text extraction and NLP process.</p> <br>
            Another project was about Customer Survey Text. Text Analysis technique was applied to enhance our machine learning models so
            we can predict the behaviour of our customers. This model could be easily applied for Employee Attrition!.

              Risk analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation were applied to answer theses questions.
